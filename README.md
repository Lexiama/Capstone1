## one interesting code

The overlay I have my product images.. When I have the time I really wanted to try it because I seen alot of the 
e-ecomm markets do this especially in beauty.. I was always fascinated and to do it was pretty cool.
I found a base image and a overlay image which will appear on hover.. both images are within a card div class 'image-container
and the images stack ontop of each other. then using css transtion like opacity:0 this means that its there but its invisible to users initially 
and the overlay opacity from 0 to 1 makes it from invisible to visible
this set set up ensures that the customer will initially see the base image while the overlay is effectivetly 
invisible and can be revealed throaugh
